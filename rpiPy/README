First: SPI


sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

make sure there IS a # before blacklist spi-bcm2708, so it looks like this...
#blacklist spi-bcm2708

Adding this # prevents SPI being disabled. If you had to change it, you'll need to 
reboot to activate SPI.

sudo reboot

You will need to install the Python SPI wrapper: (Python 2.7)

cd ~ 
git clone git://github.com/doceme/py-spidev 


If you donâ€™t have git installed, the above command will fail. Install git with...

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

When asked if you want to continue, answer Y
then, after installation, try again
git clone git://github.com/doceme/py-spidev

then it should copy the files into a directory called py-spidev. Go there next

cd py-spidev/ 
If you have already installed WiringPi for Python the next step (python-dev) may not be necessary...

then type
sudo apt-get install python-dev
y (to confirm). 

sudo python setup.py install


wget abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpio.zip
unzip pigpio.zip
cd PIGPIO
make
make install

 

There are two variables that need to be set in the start.sh script:

STUDIO=SEA
ZONE=0

THESE NEED TO BE SET! Set them to the 3 digit airport code of your studio and to what zone you want it to represent.
